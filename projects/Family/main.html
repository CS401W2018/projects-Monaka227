                <h2>Jonathan Joestar</h2>
                <p>Jonathan Joestar is the first protagonist of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, appearing in Part 1: Phantom Blood. He is a noble and honest young man with a strong sense of justice. Jonathan’s main adversary is Dio Brando, a cunning and powerful foe. Throughout his life, Jonathan trains in a technique called "Hamon" (Ripple), which he uses in his battle against Dio. Erina Pendleton (later Erina Joestar) is Jonathan’s childhood friend and his true love, who later becomes his wife.</p>

                <h2>Erina Joestar</h2>
                <p>Erina Joestar, originally Erina Pendleton, is Jonathan’s childhood friend and later his wife. She is known for her kind heart and inner strength, deeply devoted to Jonathan. After Jonathan’s passing, Erina carries on his legacy, raising their descendants and supporting the future generations of the Joestar family, including her grandson Joseph.</p>

                <h2>Joseph Joestar</h2>
                <p>Joseph is Jonathan and Erina’s grandson, and he serves as the protagonist of Part 2: Battle Tendency. Unlike his grandfather, Joseph is more of a trickster with a quick wit and a bit of a playful nature. He is intelligent, resourceful, and uses clever strategies in battle. Joseph also inherits the Hamon technique, and he goes on to confront powerful new enemies known as the Pillar Men. His personality is distinct from Jonathan’s, often relying on his wits and tactics rather than sheer resolve.</p>
