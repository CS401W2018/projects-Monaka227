    <h1>Hello, my name is Shuhada Yasumura</h1>
        <p>I was born on Osaka Japan in 2003.
            <br>I am half Indonesian, my father is Indonesian and my mother is Japanese. My parents divorced when I was 2 years old and I was raised by my grandparents from the age of 8.
            <br>Because they were members of the Church, I first learned about the LDS when I was 8 years old and converted. I am currently a CS major at BYUH and will graduate in December 2026.

    <h2>What I like</h2>
        <h3>1. Basketball</h3>
            <p>I like playing and watching basketball. I sometimes watch NBA basketball games. I'm a fun of Los Angels Lakers and Boston Celtics. My favorite NBA player is Kevin Durant. His play is so exciting to watch.</P>

        <h3>2. Movies</h3>
            <p>I like watching movies because watching movies is excitng, inspiring and educational. There are all kinds of movies out there, but I like movies that are emotional and make me cry. If you like that kind of movie, I recommend to watch "I am Sam".</p>
        <h3>3. Anime and Manga</h3>
            <p>I love anime and manga. I find them very interesting and sometimes I learn from the characters. The following is my most favorite quote from Snoopy of Peanuts.</p>
            <blockquote>&brvbar;You play with the cards you’re dealt.. Whatever that means.&brvbar;</blockquote>
