        <h1>Links</h1>

            1.Link to an outside website with an absolute link.
            </a>
            <br>2.Explain the difference between an absolute link and a relative link. Why would you use relative links?
            <br>Absolute link - Use when accessing an external site or when the domain is different. It always points to the exact location, so it can be used even if the linked URL is on a different server or domain; since it describes the entire URL, it is not affected by changes in the file structure
            <br>Relative link - Often used within the same site. If the site is moved to a different server or the domain changes, there is no need to modify the link.
            <br>Why use relative links? - Relative links are especially useful when referring to pages or files within the same domain.
            <br>

            <ol>
                <li>Same Directory Rule - When linking to a file in the same directory as the current HTML file, simply use the file name.</li>
                <li>Parent Directory Rule - To link to a file in a parent directory (one level up), use ../ followed by the file name or folder path.</li>
                <li>Subdirectory Rule - When linking to a file in a subdirectory (a folder inside the current directory), include the folder name followed by the file name.</li>
            </ol>
            <a href="https://cs401w2018.github.io/projects-Monaka227/projects/profile.html">
