            <li>JPEG is best for photos with many colors, gradients, and details, such as landscapes, portraits, or complex scenes. It compresses images by discarding some data, making it great for smaller file sizes but less ideal for high-detail editing.</li>
            <li>GIF is good for images with limited colors (up to 256 colors), like logos, icons, or simple animations. It's ideal for animations or images with flat areas of color but not suitable for detailed photos due to its limited color palette.</li>
            <li>PNG  supports lossless compression and transparency, making it great for images that require sharp details, logos.</li>
            <li>To resize a photo to its display size, use photo editing software to change its dimensions.</li>
            <li>Resizing with photo editing software reduces the actual file size, improving performance and loading speed.</li>
