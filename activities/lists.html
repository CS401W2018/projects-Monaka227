    <h1>Engagement - OL, UL</h1>
    <h2>Questions</h2>
        <p>1. What is the best way to make sure you get a good grade on the projects?
            <br>2. When is your project due?
            <br>3. What are special entity characters?
            <br>4. What is the difference between OL and UL Tags?
        </p>
    <h2>Answers</h2>
    <p>1. Turn in projects on time.
        <br>2. We learn new things on Friday and projects assignments are posted due on Monday midnight(11:59pm).
        <br>3. Special entity characters in HTML are used to display reserved or special characters that otherwise might be interpreted as part of the HTML code. These characters begin with an ampersand (&) and end with a semicolon (;).
        <br>4. ol is for ordered lists (numbered) and ul is for unordered lists (bulleted).
