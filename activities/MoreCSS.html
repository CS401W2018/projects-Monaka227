        <h2>Answers</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Block tags create elements that take up the full width of their container, stacking vertically. Inline tags, on the other hand, only take up as much space as their content requires and stack horizontally within the same line.</li>
            <li>Margin is the space outside the element's border, separating it from other elements. Border is the line surrounding the element. Padding is the space between the content of the element and its border.</li>
            <li>CSS uses units like pixels (px), em, rem, percentages (%), and viewport units like vw (viewport width) and vh (viewport height).</li>
            <li>The figure tag is used to wrap content such as images, diagrams, or illustrations that are referenced within the main content, often along with a caption.</li>
        </ol>
