                <h3>Ancient Egypt:</h3>
                <p>By 3100 BCE, board games had become popular among pharaohs in ancient Egypt. A game called "Senet" was discovered in pre-dynastic and First Dynasty pyramids, with wall paintings depicting Egyptian queens playing the game. Senet boards were often buried with royalty as talismans for the journey to the afterlife.</p>

                <h3>Religious and Strategic Games:</h3>
                <p>Around 3000 BCE, board games spread to the working class in Egypt. By 1300 BCE, the influence of warfare led to the creation of strategy games, such as "Ludus latrunculorum" in the Roman Empire, which had similarities to chess and influenced the movement of pawns in early chess variants.</p>

                <p>In 400 BCE, the first board game in Eastern culture, "Liubo," emerged. This two-player dice game was discovered in a Han Dynasty tomb in 1973, revealing its complete set and rules.</p>

            <h3>Modern Board Games:</h3>
                <p>The evolution of board games continued through the centuries, leading to the development of modern classics. For example, Scrabble, a popular word game, has its roots in the 1930s. Architect Alfred Mosher Butts invented a game called Lexiko in 1931, which later evolved into Scrabble. The game gained widespread popularity in the 1950s and has since become a global phenomenon, with world championships being held since 1992.
                    <br>
                    <br>Board games have not only provided entertainment but also served educational purposes. Games like Scrabble help players improve their vocabulary, learn word patterns, and enhance language skills.
                    <br>
                    <br>The rich history of board games demonstrates their enduring appeal and cultural significance across civilizations and time periods.
