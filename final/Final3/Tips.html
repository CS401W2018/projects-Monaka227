                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Initial Arrangement: </strong>In Catan, each player owns two settlements from the beginning. The placement of these is very important. It is important to place them adjacent to a probable location (e.g. 6 or 8), but also to ensure a 3:1 port.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resource Balance: </strong>It is unlikely that all resources will be in balance in Catan. Therefore, it is important to know how to resolve bias when it occurs. However, other players will not negotiate with you when you have the advantage. Therefore, it is necessary to secure 3:1 ports or specialized ports (2:1 ports). It is also necessary to understand the value of resources. Remember that <strong>Ore</strong> and <strong>Wheat</strong> are basically more valuable than other resources, depending on your strategy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Longest Road and Largest Army: </strong>Catan is a game where the goal is to score a total of 10 points, but you can easily get up to 6 points. The only thing you need to do is to get the next 4 points. The Longest Road or the Largest Army, which can secure half of the four points, should be acquired. You can earn points without consuming any resources, so you should aim for them aggressively. However, other players will also try to get these points, so it is important not to lose them to the top scorer at the same time. It is also a good strategy to give resources to other players so that the top player can get the resources from the lower ranked players.</li>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Memorize the characteristics of each company: </strong>There are a variety of companies in this board game. And each company has its own way of winning. You also have to change the cards you use depending on the company your opponent has chosen. If there is a draft rule, it is as important to collect the cards you want as it is to discard the cards your opponent wants. For example, if you are playing against Credicor or Saturn Systems, be cautious.</li>
                    <li><strong>Combo or Aggro: </strong>There are two broad tactics: combo and aggro. Combo (or control) is a strategy to delay the game as long as possible and use as many strong cards as possible or use clock cards to score points. Aggro, on the other hand, aims to score as many points as possible and end the game as quickly as possible, and when using companies like Credicor, Saturn Systems. On the other hand, if your opponents are using these companies, you should aim for an early end to the game. Companies that are good for aggro are Ecoline, Helion, Phobolog, etc.</li>
                    <li><strong>Awards and Milestones: </strong></li>Awards and milestones are very important scoring points. Especially milestones are worth 5 points in 8MC just to secure them. It is a good idea to secure one milestone for combo and two for aggro. On the other hand, awards have a lower priority than milestones in a three-player game or more. Even if you can buy them, do not buy them until the last possible moment. If you buy them first, you will be at a disadvantage because of the 8 MCs you spent to buy them. Ideally, you should purchase them just before your opponent takes them.

                    <li><strong>Bonus Points: </strong>As for the first three bonus conditions that are handed out, ignore them and discard all but the highest scoring ones. It is better to go for the tracks that require 5 or 6 cards than to get a half-assed bonus. However, you may only go for the Longest bonus.</li>
                    <li><strong>Take 5 or 6 Tracks </strong>Basically, take 5 or 6 tracks as much as possible. The game is not based on the amount of resources, so the higher score you can get from the same resources is the difference between winning and losing.</li>

                    <li><strong>The top two rows always have a tile for every round: </strong>Basically, the more tiles you place, the more points you score, so be sure to place tiles in the top two tiers, which are easy to place, in every round of the game.</li>
                    <li><strong>Aim for the Bonus: </strong>Place the tiles in such a way as to maximize the score as much as possible. If you place a tile to create a gap and fill it later, you will lose a few points. Also, take the vertical placement bonus and the color bonus. Take two or three column placement bonuses. Aim to get a color bonus once or twice.</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't be afraid lose points: </strong>If you are in a situation where you have a tile you want but it leads to a loss, don't be afraid to go for it. azul can score a lot of points in the second half, so even if you lose 2 or 3 points, you can score more than that.</li>

                    <li><strong>Obtain the third flag from the end: </strong>Getting the third flag from the end is a big step closer to victory. This is because the third flag from the end does not lead to defeat if the first and second flags from the end are taken by the opponent.</li>
                    <li><strong>Decide on the flag that can be taken: </strong>It is impossible to win all the flags in this game. In other words, you have to assume that you will lose some of the games. If you lose, try to lose on a flag as close to the edge as possible. This will prevent you from losing by winning three flags in a row.</li>
                    <li><strong>How to use Tactics Cards: </strong>The first prerequisite is to learn all the contents of the Tactics cards: there are only 10 cards, but they are all powerful, and some of them can decide the winner with a single card. Tactics cards should only be used if they are “decisive” or “will give you a high priority flag”.</li>

                    <li><strong>Win in three rounds: </strong>On average, code names are often won in 3 or 4 rounds. So do the math to win in 3 rounds. If you are the later team, you may try to win in two rounds. Plan how many rounds you will win at the beginning of the game.</li>
                    <li><strong>Leave a sabotage card: </strong>If there is a similarity between the opponent's team's word and your team's word, collect it at the end of the game. By doing so, you can induce your opponent to make a mistake.</li>
